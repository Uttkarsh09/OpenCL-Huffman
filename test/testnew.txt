We live in a digital era in which communication is largely based on the exchange of digital information on data
networks. For seamless and rapid communication, an encoding approach that ensures efficiency, simplicity, and
security becomes imperative. This necessitates the utilization of parallel computing techniques for compression
and encryption, guaranteeing optimized and swift data handling while upholding stringent security measures.
Data compression and encryption are fundamental processes in information management and security. Parallel
computing, which involves simultaneous task execution by multiple processors or cores, has the potential to
greatly accelerate these operations.
In the context of encryption, specifically focusing on the AES algorithm, parallel computing can significantly
expedite its encryption and decryption processes. Large files can be divided into blocks, and these blocks can be
encrypted in parallel by different processors or core similar to the compression. Also, it's crucial to recognize that
the processed data, especially images, must not only be securely transmitted but also retain the ability to undergo
efficient decompression and decryption upon arrival. This necessitates a balanced approach, where the
advantages of parallel computing for compression and encryption are harnessed while ensuring that the
reconstructed data can be seamlessly restored to its original form.
We propose to implement a system which performs data compression and encryption using parallel computing
platforms like CUDA and OpenCL which offer great efficiency in terms of time and power usage. The proposed
implementation will offer portability, independent of end-user hardware and operating system requirements.
