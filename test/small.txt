And Then There Were None
Agatha Christie

Chapter 
In the corner of a firstclass smoking carriage Mr Justice Wargrave lately retired from the
bench puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye through the political news in the Times
He laid the paper down and glanced out of the window They were running now through
Somerset He glanced at his watch  another two hours to go
He went over in his mind all that had appeared in the papers about Indian Island There had
been its original purchase by an American millionaire who was crazy about yachting  and
an account of the luxurious modern house he had built on this little island off the Devon
coast The unfortunate fact that the new third wife of the American millionaire was a bad
sailor had led to the subsequent putting up of the house and island for sale Various glowing
advertisements of it had appeared in the papers Then came the first bald statement that it
had been bought  by a Mr Owen After that the rumours of the gossip writers had started
Indian Island had really been bought by Miss Gabrielle Turl the Hollywood film star She
wanted to spend some months there free from all publicity Busy Bee had hinted delicately
that it was to be an abode for Royalty Mr Merryweather had had it whispered to him that
it had been bought for a honeymoon  Young Lord L had surrendered to Cupid at last
Jones knew for a fact that it had been purchased by the Admiralty with a view to carrying
out some very hush hush experiments
Definitely Indian Island was news
From his pocket Mr Justice Wargrave drew out a letter The handwriting was practically
illegible but words here and there stood out with unexpected clarity Dearest Lawrence
such years since I heard anything of you must come to Indian Island the most
enchanting place so much to talk over old days communion with Nature bask in
sunshine  from Paddington meet you at Oakbridge and his correspondent signed
herself with a flourish his ever Constance Culmington
Mr Justice Wargrave cast back in his mind to remember when exactly he had last seen Lady
Constance Culmington It must be seven  no eight years ago She had then been going to
Italy to bask in the sun and be at one with Nature and the contadini Later he had heard
she had proceeded to Syria where she proposed to bask in yet stronger sun and live at one
with Nature and the bedouin
Constance Culmington he reflected to himself was exactly the sort of woman who would
buy an island and surround herself with mystery Nodding his head in gentle approval of his
logic Mr Justice Wargrave allowed his head to nod He slept

II
Vera Claythorne in a thirdclass carriage with five other travellers in it leaned her head
back and shut her eyes How hot it was travelling by train today It would be nice to get to
the sea Really a great piece of luck getting this job When you wanted a holiday post it
nearly always meant looking after a swarm of children  secretarial holiday posts were much
more difficult to get Even the agency hadnt held out much hope
And then the letter had come
I have received your name from the Skilled Womens Agency together with their
recommendation I understand they know you personally I shall be glad to pay you the
salary you ask and shall expect you to take up your duties on August th The train is the
 from Paddington and you will be met at Oakbridge station I enclose five pound notes
for expenses
Yours truly
Una Nancy Owen
And at the top was the stamped address Indian Island Sticklehaven Devon
Indian Island Why there had been nothing else in the papers lately All sorts of hints and
interesting rumours Though probably that was mostly untrue But the house had certainly
been built by a millionaire and was said to be absolutely the last word in luxury
Vera Claythorne tired by a recent strenuous term at school thought to herself  Being a
games mistress in a thirdclass school isnt much of a catch If only I could get a job at
some decent school
And then with a cold feeling round her heart she thought But Im lucky to have even this
After all people dont like a Coroners Inquest even if the Coroner did acquit me of all
blame
He had even complimented her on her presence of mind and courage she remembered For
an inquest it couldnt have gone better And Mrs Hamilton had been kindness itself to her only Hugo  but she wouldnt think of Hugo
Suddenly in spite of the heat in the carriage she shivered and wished she wasnt going to
the sea A picture rose clearly before her mind Cyrils head bobbing up and down
swimming to the rock Up and down  up and down And herself swimming in easy
practised strokes after him  cleaving her way through the water but knowing only too
surely that she wouldnt be in time

The sea  its deep warm blue mornings spent lying out on the sands  Hugo  Hugo who had
said he loved her
She must not think of Hugo
She opened her eyes and frowned across at the man opposite her A tall man with a brown
face light eyes set rather close together and an arrogant almost cruel mouth
She thought to herself
I bet hes been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some interesting things

III
Philip Lombard summing up the girl opposite in a mere flash of his quick moving eyes
thought to himself
Quite attractive  a bit schoolmistressy perhaps
A cool customer he should imagine  and one who could hold her own  in love or war Hed
rather like to take her on
He frowned No cut out all that kind of stuff This was business Hed got to keep his mind
on the job
What exactly was up he wondered That little Jew had been damned mysterious
Take it or leave it Captain Lombard
He had said thoughtfully
A hundred guineas eh
He had said it in a casual way as though a hundred guineas was nothing to him A hundred
guineas when he was literally down to his last square meal He had fancied though that the
little Jew had not been deceived  that was the damnable part about Jews you couldnt
deceive them about money  they knew
He had said in the same casual tone
And you cant give me any further information

Mr Isaac Morris had shaken his little bald head very positively
No Captain Lombard the matter rests there It is understood by my client that your
reputation is that of a good man in a tight place I am empowered to hand you one hundred
guineas in return for which you will travel to Sticklehaven Devon The nearest station is
Oakbridge you will be met there and motored to Sticklehaven where a motor launch will
convey you to Indian Island There you will hold yourself at the disposal of my client
Lombard had said abruptly
For how long
Not longer than a week at most
Fingering his small moustache Captain Lombard said
You understand I cant undertake anything  illegal
He had darted a very sharp glance at the other as he had spoken There had been a very
faint smile on the thick Semitic lips of Mr Morris as he answered gravely
If anything illegal is proposed you will of course be at perfect liberty to withdraw
Damn the smooth little brute he had smiled It was as though he knew very well that in
Lombards past actions legality had not always been a sine qua non
Lombards own lips parted in a grin
By Jove hed sailed pretty near the wind once or twice But hed always got away with it
There wasnt much he drew the line at really
No there wasnt much hed draw the line at He fancied that he was going to enjoy himself
at Indian Island

In a nonsmoking carriage Miss Emily Brent sat very upright as was her custom She was
sixtyfive and she did not approve of lounging Her father a Colonel of the old school had
been particular about deportment
The present generation was shamelessly lax  in their carriage and in every other way

Enveloped in an aura of righteousness and unyielding principles Miss Brent sat in her
crowded thirdclass carriage and triumphed over its discomfort and its heat Every one
made such a fuss over things nowadays They wanted injections before they had teeth pulled
 they took drugs if they couldnt sleep  they wanted easy chairs and cushions and the girls
allowed their figures to slop about anyhow and lay about half naked on the beaches in
summer
Miss Brents lips set closely She would like to make an example of certain people
She remembered last years summer holiday This year however it would be quite different
Indian Island
Mentally she reread the letter which she had already read so many times
Dear Miss Brent
I do hope you remember me We were together at Bellhaven Guest House in August some
years ago and we seemed to have so much in common
I am starting a guest house of my own on an island off the coast of Devon I think there is
really an opening for a place where there is good plain cooking and a nice oldfashioned
type of person None of this nudity and gramophones half the night I shall be very glad if
you could see your way to spending your summer holiday on Indian Island  quite free  as
my guest Would early in August suit you Perhaps the th
Yours sincerely
UN What was the name The signature was rather difficult to read Emily Brent thought
impatiently So many people write their signatures quite illegibly
She let her mind run back over the people at Bellhaven She had been there two summers
running There had been that nice middleaged woman  Mrs  Mrs  now what was her
name  her father had been a Canon And there had been a Miss Olton  Ormen  No surely
it was Oliver Yes  Oliver
Indian Island There had been things in the paper about Indian Island  something about a
film star  or was it an American millionaire
Of course often those places went very cheap  islands didnt suit everybody They thought
the idea was romantic but when they came to live there they realized the disadvantages and
were only too glad to sell

Emily Brent thought to herself I shall be getting a free holiday at any rate
With her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being paid that was indeed
something to take into consideration If only she could remember a little more about Mrs or was it Miss  Oliver

General Macarthur looked out of the carriage window The train was just coming into Exeter
where he had to change Damnable these slow branch line trains This place Indian Island
was really no distance at all as the crow flies
He hadnt got it clear who this fellow Owen was A friend of Spoof Leggards apparently and of Johnny Dyers
 One or two of your old cronies are coming  would like to have a talk over old times
Well hed enjoy a chat about old times Hed had a fancy lately that fellows were rather
lighting shy of him All owing to that damned rumour By God it was pretty hard  nearly
thirty years ago now Armstrong had talked he supposed Damned young pup What did he
know about it Oh well no good brooding about these things One fancied things
sometimes  fancied a fellow was looking at you queerly
This Indian Island now hed be interested to see it A lot of gossip flying about Looked as
though there might be something in the rumour that the Admiralty or the War Office or the
Air Force had got hold of it
Young Elmer Robson the American millionaire had actually built the place Spent
thousands on it so it was said Every mortal luxury
Exeter And an hour to wait And he didnt want to wait He wanted to get on

VI
Dr Armstrong was driving his Morris across Salisbury Plain He was very tired Success
had its penalties There had been a time when he had sat in his consulting room in Harley
Street correctly apparelled surrounded with the most uptodate appliances and the most
luxurious furnishings and waited  waited through the empty days for his venture to succeed
or fail

Well it had succeeded Hed been lucky Lucky and skillful of course He was a good man at
his job  but that wasnt enough for success You had to have luck as well And hed had it
An accurate diagnosis a couple of grateful women patients  women with money and
position  and word had got about You ought to try Armstrong  quite a young man  but so
clever  Pam had been to all sorts of people for years and he put his finger on the trouble at
once The ball had started rolling
And now Dr Armstrong had definitely arrived His days were full He had little leisure And
so on this August morning he was glad that he was leaving London and going to be for
some days on an island off the Devon coast Not that it was exactly a holiday The letter he
had received had been rather vague in its terms but there was nothing vague about the
accompanying cheque A whacking fee These Owens must be rolling in money Some little
difficulty it seemed a husband who was worried about his wifes health and wanted a
report on it without her being alarmed She wouldnt hear of seeing a doctor Her nerves Nerves The doctors eyebrows went up These women and their nerves Well it was good
for business after all Half the women who consulted him had nothing the matter with them
but boredom but they wouldnt thank you for telling them so And one could usually find
something
A slightly uncommon condition of the  some long word  nothing at all serious  but it just
needs putting right A simple treatment
Well medicine was mostly faithhealing when it came to it And he had a good manner  he
could inspire hope and belief
Lucky that hed managed to pull himself together in time after that business ten  no fifteen
years ago It had been a near thing that Hed been going to pieces The shock had pulled
him together Hed cut out drink altogether By Jove it had been a near thing though
With a devastating carsplitting blast on the horn an enormous Super Sports Dalmain car
rushed past him at eighty miles an hour Dr Armstrong nearly went into the hedge One of
these young fools who tore round the country He hated them That had been a near shave
too Damned young fool

VII
Tony Marston roaring down into Mere thought to himself
The amount of cars crawling about the roads is frightful Always something blocking your
way And they will drive in the middle of the road Pretty hopeless driving in England
anyway Not like France where you really could let out

Should he stop here for a drink or push on Heaps of time Only another hundred miles and
a bit to go Hed have a gin and gingerbeer Fizzing hot day
This island place ought to be rather good fun  if the weather lasted Who were these Owens
he wondered Rich and stinking probably Badger was rather good at nosing people like
that out Of course he had to poor old chap with no money of his own
Hope theyd do one well in drinks Never knew with these fellows whod made their money
and werent born to it Pity that story about Gabrielle Turl having bought Indian Island
wasnt true Hed like to have been in with that film star crowd
Oh well he supposed thered be a few girls there
Coming out of the Hotel he stretched himself yawned looked up at the blue sky and
climbed into the Dalmain
Several young women looked at him admiringly  his six feet of wellproportioned body his
crisp hair tanned face and intensely blue eyes
He let in the clutch with a roar and leapt up the narrow street Old men and errand boys
jumped for safety The latter looked after the car admiringly
Anthony Marston proceeded on his triumphal progress

VIII
Mr Blore was in the slow train from Plymouth There was only one other person in his
carriage an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye At the present moment he had
dropped off to sleep
Mr Blore was writing carefully in a little notebook
Thats the lot he muttered to himself Emily Brent Vera Claythorne Dr Armstrong
Anthony Marston old Justice Wargrave Philip Lombard General Macarthur CMG
DSO Manservant and wife Mr and Mrs Rogers
He closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket He glanced over at the corner and the
slumbering man
Had one over the eight diagnosed Mr Blore accurately He went over things carefully and
conscientiously in his mind

Job ought to be easy enough he ruminated Dont see how I can slip up on it Hope I look
all right
He stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass The face reflected there was of a
slightly military cast with a moustache There was very little expression in it The eyes were
grey and set rather close together
Might be a Major said Mr Blore No I forgot Theres that old military gent Hed spot
me at once
South Africa said Mr Blore thats my line None of these people have anything to do
with South Africa and Ive just been reading that travel folder so I can talk about it all
right
Fortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials As a man of means from South
Africa Mr Blore felt that he could enter into any society unchallenged
