And Then There Were None

 CHAPTER 1

 IN THE CORNER of a first-class smoking carriage, Mr. Justice Wargrave,
 lately retired from the bench, puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye
 through the political news in the Times.
 He laid the paper down and glanced out of the window. They were running now
 through Somerset. He glanced at his watch-another two hours to go. He went
 over in his mind all that had appeared in the papers about Indian Island.
 There had been its original purchase by an American millionaire who was crazy
 about yachting-and an account of the luxurious modern house he had built on
 this little island off the Devon coast. The unfortunate fact that the new
 third wife of the American millionaire was a bad sailor had led to the
 subsequent putting up of the house and island for sale. Various glowing
 advertisements of it had appeared in the papers. Then came the first bald
 statement that it had been bought-by a Mr. Owen. After that the rurnours
 of the gossip writers had started. Indian Island had really been bought by
 Miss Gabrielle Turl, the Hollywood film star! She wanted to spend some
 months there free from all publicity! Busy Bee had hinted delicately that
 it was to be an abode for Royalty??! Mr. Merryweather had had it whispered
 to him that it had been bought for a honeymoon-Young Lord L-- had
 surrendered to Cupid at last! Jonas knew for a fact that it had been
 purchased by the Admiralty with a view to carrying out some very hush hush
 experiments!
 Definitely, Indian Island was news!
 From his pocket Mr. Justice Wargrave drew out a letter. The handwriting was
 practically illegible but words here and there stood out with unexpected
 clarity. Dearest Lawrence . . . such years since I heard anything of you
 . . . must come to Indian Island . . . the most enchanting place . . . so
 much to talk over . . . old days . . . communion with Nature . . . bask
 in sunshine . . . 12.40 from Paddington . . . meet you at Oakbridge . . .
 and his correspondent signed herself with
 a flourish his ever Constance Culmington.
 Mr. Justice Wargrave cast back in his mind to remember when exactly he had
 last seen Lady Constance Culmington. It must be seven -no, eight years ago.
 She had then been going to Italy to bask in the sun and be at one with
 Nature and the contaditd. Later, he had heard, she had proceeded to Syria
 where she proposed to bask in yet stronger sun and live at one with Nature
 and the bedouin. Constance Culmington, he reflected to himself, was exactly
 the sort of woman who would buy an island and surround herself with
 mystery! Nodding his head in gentle approval of his logic, Mr. Justice
 Wargrave allowed his head to nod. He slept. . . .

 Vera Claythorne, in a third-class carriage with five other travellers in
 it, leaned her head back and shut her eyes. How hot it was travelling by
 train to-day! It would be nice to get to the sea! Really a great piece of
 luck getting this job. When you wanted a holiday post it nearly always
 meant looking after a swarm of children-secretarial holiday posts were much
 more difficult to get. Even the agency hadn't held out much hope.
 And then the letter had come.

 "I have received your name from the Skilled Women's Agency together with
 their recommendation. I understand they know you personally. I shall be
 glad to pay you the salary you ask and shall expect you to take up your
 duties on August 8th. The train is the 12.40 from Paddington and you will
 be met at Oakbridge station. I enclose five pound notes for expenses.

 Yours truly,
 Una Nancy Owen."

 And at the top was the stamped address Indian Island, Sticklehaven, Devon.
 . . .
 Indian Island! Why, there had been nothing else in the papers lately! All
 sorts of hints and interesting rumours. Though probably

 that was mostly untrue. But the house had certainly been built by a
 millionaire and was said to be absolutely the last word in luxury.
 Vera Claythorne, tired by a recent strenuous term at school, thought to
 herself-"Being a games mistress in a third-class school isn't much of a
 catch. school."
 And then, with a cold feeling round her heart, she thought: "But I'm lucky
 to have even this. After all, people don't like a Coroner's Inquest, even
 if the Coroner did acquit me of all blame!"
 He had even complimented her on her presence of mind and courage, she
 remembered. For an inquest it couldn't have gone better. And Mrs. Hamilton
 had been kindness itself to her- Only Hugo(but she wouldn't think of Hugo!)
 Suddenly, in spite of the heat in the carriage she shivered and wished she
 wasn't going to the sea. A picture rose clearly before her mind. Cyril's
 head, bobbing up and down, swimming to the rock. . . . Up and down-up and
 down. . . . And herself, swimming in easy practised strokes after him-
 cleaving her way through the water but knowing, only too surely, that she
 wouldn't be in time. . . . The sea-its deep warm blue-mornings spent lying
 out on the sands-Hugo-Hugo who had said he loved her.
 She must not think of Hugo. . . .
 She opened her eyes and frowned across at the man opposite her. A tall man
 with a brown face, light eyes set rather close together and an arrogant
 almost cruel mouth.
 She thought to herself:
 "I bet he's been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some
 interesting things. . . ."

 . If only I could get a job at some decent

 Philip Lombard, summing up the girl opposite in a mere flash of
 his quick moving eyes thought to himself:
 "Quite attractive-a bit schoolmistressy perhaps.
 A cool customer, he should imagine-and one who could hold her
 own-in love or war. He'd rather like to take her on. . . .
 He frowned. No, cut out all that kind of stuff. This was business. He'd got
 to keep his mind on the job.
 194 MASTERPIECES OF MURDER

 What exactly was up, he wondered? That little Jew had been damned
 mysterious. "Take it or leave it, Captain Lombard."
 He had said thoughtfully:
 "A hundred guineas, eh?"
 He had said it in a casual way as though a hundred guineas was nothing to
 him. A hundred guineas when he was literally down to his last square meal!
 He had fancied, though, that the little Jew had not been deceived-that was
 the damnable part about Jews, you couldn't deceive them about money-they
 knewl
 He had said in the same casual tone:
 "And you can't give me any further information?"
 Mr. Isaac Morris had shaken his little bald head very positively.
 "No, Captain Lombard, the matter rests there. It is understood by my client
 that your reputation is that of a good man in a tight place. I am empowered
 to hand you one hundred guineas in return for which you will travel to
 Sticklehaven, Devon. The nearest station is Oakbridge, you will be met
 there and motored to Sticklehaven where a motor launch will convey you to
 Indian Island. There you will hold yourself at the disposal of my client."
 Lombard had said abruptly:
 "For how long?"
 "Not longer than a week at most."
 Fingering his small moustache, Captain Lombard said:
 "You understand I can't undertake anything-illegal?"
 He had darted a very sharp glance at the other as he had spoken. There had
 been a very faint smile on the thick Semitic lips of Mr. Morris as he
 answered gravely:
 "If anything illegal is proposed, you will, of course, be at perfect
 liberty to withdraw."
 Damn the smooth little brute, he had smiled! It was as though he knew very
 well that in Lombard's past actions legality had not always been a sine qua
 non. . Lombard's own lips parted in a grin.
 By Jove, he'd sailed pretty near the wind once or twice! But he'd always
 got away with it! There wasn't much he drew the line at really. . . .
 No, there wasn't much he'd draw the fine at. He fancied that he was going
 to enjoy himself at Indian Island. . . .

 In a non-smoking carriage Miss Emily Brent sat very upright as was her
 custom. She was sixty-five and she did not approve of lounging. Her father,
 a Colonel of the old school, had been particular about deportment.
 The present generation was shamelessly lax-in their carriage, and in every
 other way.
 Enveloped in an aura of righteousness and unyielding principles, Miss Brent
 sat in her crowded third-class carriage and triumphed over its discomfort
 and its heat. Every one made such a fuss over things nowadays! They wanted
 injections before they had teeth pulled -they took drugs if they couldn't
 sleep-they wanted easy chairs and cushions and the girls allowed their
 figures to slop about anyhow and lay about half naked on the beaches in
 summer.
 Miss Brent's lips set closely. She would like to make an example of certain
 people.
 She remembered last year's summer holiday. This year, however, it would be
 quite different. Indian Island. . . .
 Mentally she reread the letter which she had already read so many times.
 
 Dear Miss Brent,
 I do hope you remember me? We were together at Bellhaven Guest House in
 August some years ago, and we seemed to have so much in common.
 I am starting a guest house of my own on an island og the coast of Devon.
 I think there is really an opening for a place where there is good plain
 cooking and a nice old-fashioned type of person. None of this nudity and
 gramophones half the night. I shall be very glad if you could see your way
 to spending your summer holiday on Indian Island-quite free-as my guest.
 Would early in August suit you? Perhaps the 81h.

 Yours sincerely,

 U. N. -
 What was the name? The signature was rather difficult to read. Emily Brent
 thought impatiently: "So many people write their signatures quite
 illegibly."

 She let her mind run back over the people at Bellhaven. She had been there
 two summers running. There had been that nice middleaged woman-Mrs.-Mrs.-
 now what was her name?-her father had been a Canon. And there had been a
 Miss Olton-Ormen- No, surely it was Oliver! Yes-Oliver.
 Indian Island! There had been things in the paper about Indian Island-
 something about a film star-or was it an American millionaire?
 Of course often those places went very cheap-islands didn't suit everybody.
 They thought the idea was romantic but when they came to live there they
 realized the disadvantages and were only too glad to sell.
 Emily Brent thought to herself: "I shall be getting a free holiday at any
 rate." With her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being
 paid, that was indeed something to take into consideration. If only she
 could remember a little more about Mrs.-or was it MissOliver?

 General Macarthur looked out of the carriage window. The train was just
 coming into Exeter where he had to change. Damnable, these slow branch line
 trains! This place, Indian Island, was really no distance at all as the
 crow flies. He hadn't got it clear who this fellow Owen was. A friend of
 Spoof Leggard's, apparently-and of Johnny Dyer's.
 -One or two of your old cronies are coming-would like to have a talk over
 old times.
 Well, he'd enjoy a chat about old times. He'd had a fancy lately that
 fellows were rather fighting shy of him. All owing to that damned rumour!
 By God, it was pretty hard-nearly thirty years ago now! Armitage had
 talked, he supposed. Damned young pup! What did he know about it? Oh, well,
 no good brooding about these things! One fancied things sometimes-fancied
 a fellow was looking at you queerly. This Indian Island now, he'd be
 interested to see it. A lot of gossip flying about. Looked as though there
 might be something in the

 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE

 rumour that the Admiralty or the War Office or the Air Force had got hold
 of it. . . .
 Young Elmer Robson, the American millionaire, had actually built the place.
 Spent thousands on it, so it was said. Every mortal luxury. . . .
 Exeter! And an hour to wait! And he didn't want to wait. He wanted to get
 on.

 Dr. Armstrong was driving his Morris across Salisbury Plain. He was very
 tired. . . . Success had its penalties. There had been a time when he had
 sat in his consulting room in Harley Street, correctly apparelled,
 surrounded with the most up-to-date appliances and the most luxurious
 furnishings and waited-waited through the empty days for his venture to
 succeed or fail. . . *
 Well, it had succeeded! He'd been lucky! Lucky and skilful of course. He
 was a good man at his job-but that wasn't enough for success. You had to
 have luck as well. And he'd had it! An accurate diagnosis, a couple of
 grateful women patients-women with money and position-and word had got
 about. "You ought to try Armstrong -quite a young man-but so clever- Pam
 had been to all sorts of people for years and he put his finger on the
 trouble at once!" The ball had started rolling.
 And now Dr. Armstrong had definitely arrived. His days were full. He had
 little leisure. And so, on this August morning, he was glad that he was
 leaving London and going to be for some days on an island off the Devon
 coast. Not that it was exactly a holiday. The letter he had received had
 been rather vague in its terms, but there was nothing vague about the
 accompanying cheque. A whacking fee. These Owens must be rolling in money.
 Some little difficulty, it seemed, a husband who was worried about his
 wife's health and wanted a report on it without her being alarmed. She
 wouldn't hear of seeing a doctor. Her nerves-
 Nerves! The doctor's eyebrows went up. These women and their nerves! Well,
 it was good for business, after all. Half the women who consulted him had
 nothing the matter with them but boredom, but they wouldn't thank you for
 telling them so! And one could usually find something.
 198 MASTERPIECES OF MURDER

 "A slightly uncommon condition of the-some long word-nothing at all
 serious-but it just needs putting right. A simple treatment."
 Well, medicine was mostly faith-healing when it came to it. And he had a
 good manner-he could inspire hope and belief.
 Lucky that he'd managed to pull himself together in time after that
 business ten-no, fifteen years ago. It had been a near thing, that! He'd
 been going to pieces. The shock had pulled him together. He'd cut out drink
 altogether. By Jove, it had been a near thing though. . . .
 With a devastating ear-splitting blast on the hom an enormous Super Sports
 Dalmain car rushed past him at eighty miles an hour. Dr. Armstrong nearly
 went into the hedge. One of these young fools who tore round the country.
 He hated them. That had been a near shave, too. Damned young fool!

 Tony Marston, roaring down into Mere, thought to himself:
 "The amount of cars crawling about the roads is frightful. Always something
 blocking your way. And they will drive in the middle of the road! Pretty
 hopeless driving in England, anyway. . . . Not like France where you really
 could let out. . . ."
 Should he stop here for a drink, or push on? Heaps of time! Only another
 hundred miles and a bit to go. He'd have a gin and gingerbeer. Fizzing hot
 day! This island place ought to be rather good fun-if the weather lasted.
 Who were these Owens, he wondered? Rich and stinking, probably. Badger was
 rather good at nosing people like that out. Of course, he had to, poor old
 chap, with no money of his own. .
 Hope they'd do one well in drinks. Never knew with these fellows who'd made
 their money and weren't born to it. Pity that story about Gabrielle Turl
 having bought Indian Island wasn't true. He'd like to have been in with
 that film star crowd. Oh, well, he supposed there'd be a few girls there.
 . . .
 Coming out of the Hotel, he stretched himself, yawned, looked up at the
 blue sky and climbed into the Dalmain.
 Several young women looked at him admiringly-his six feet of well-
 proportioned body, his crisp hair, tanned face, and intensely blue eyes.

 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE

 He let in the clutch with a roar and leapt up the narrow street. Old men
 and errand boys jumped for safety. The latter looked after the car
 admiringly. Anthony Marston proceeded on his triumphal progress.

 Mr. Blore was in the slow train from Plymouth. There was only one other
 person in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye.
 At the present moment he had dropped off to sleep.
 Mr. Blore was writing carefully in a little notebook.
 "That's the lot," he muttered to himself. "Emily Brent, Vera Claythorne,
 Dr. Armstrong, Anthony Marston, old Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard,
 General Macarthur, C.M.G., D.S.O. Manservant and wife: Mr. and Mrs.
 Rogers." He closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. He glanced
 over at the comer and the slumbering man.
 "Had one over the eight," diagnosed Mr. Blore accurately.
 He went over things carefully and conscientiously in his mind.
 "Job ought to be easy enough," he ruminated. "Don't see how I can slip up
 on it. Hope I look all right."
 He stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass. The face
 reflected there was of a slightly military cast with a moustache. There was
 very little expression in it. The eyes were grey and set rather close
 together. "Might be a Major," said Mr. Blore. "No, I forgot. There's that
 old military gent. He'd spot me at once.
 "South Africa," said Mr. Blore, "that's my line! None of these people have
 anything to do with South Africa, and I've just been reading that travel
 folder so I can talk about it all right."
 Fortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials. As a man of means
 from South Africa, Mr. Blore felt that he could enter into any society
 unchallenged. Indian Island. He remembered Indian Island as a boy.
 Smelly sort of rock covered with gulls-stood about a mile from the coast.
 It had got its name from its resemblance to a man's head-an American Indian
 profile. Funny idea to go and build a house on it! Awful in bad weather!
 But millionaires were full of wbims!

 The old man in the comer woke up and said:
 "You can't never tell at sea-never!"
 Mr. Blore said soothingly, "That's right. You can't."
 The old man hiccuped twice and said plaintively:
 "There's a squall coming."
 Mr. Blore said:
 "No, no, mate, it's a lovely day."
 The old man said angrily:

 leaving London and going to be for some days on an island off the Devon
 coast. Not that it was exactly a holiday. The letter he had received had
 been rather vague in its terms, but there was nothing vague about the
 accompanying cheque. A whacking fee. These Owens must be rolling in money.
 Some little difficulty, it seemed, a husband who was worried about his
 wife's health and wanted a report on it without her being alarmed. She
 wouldn't hear of seeing a doctor. Her nerves-
 Nerves! The doctor's eyebrows went up. These women and their nerves! Well,
 it was good for business, after all. Half the women who consulted him had
 nothing the matter with them but boredom, but they wouldn't thank you for
 telling them so! And one could usually find something.

 "A slightly uncommon condition of the-some long word-nothing at all
 serious-but it just needs putting right. A simple treatment."
 Well, medicine was mostly faith-healing when it came to it. And he had a
 good manner-he could inspire hope and belief.
 Lucky that he'd managed to pull himself together in time after that
 business ten-no, fifteen years ago. It had been a near thing, that! He'd
 been going to pieces. The shock had pulled him together. He'd cut out drink
 altogether. By Jove, it had been a near thing though. . . .
 With a devastating ear-splitting blast on the hom an enormous Super Sports
 Dalmain car rushed past him at eighty miles an hour. Dr. Armstrong nearly
 went into the hedge. One of these young fools who tore round the country.
 He hated them. That had been a near shave, too. Damned young fool!

 Tony Marston, roaring down into Mere, thought to himself:
 "The amount of cars crawling about the roads is frightful. Always something
 blocking your way. And they will drive in the middle of the road! Pretty
 hopeless driving in England, anyway. . . . Not like France where you really
 could let out. . . ."
 Should he stop here for a drink, or push on? Heaps of time! Only another
 hundred miles and a bit to go. He'd have a gin and gingerbeer. Fizzing hot
 day! This island place ought to be rather good fun-if the weather lasted.
 Who were these Owens, he wondered? Rich and stinking, probably. Badger was
 rather good at nosing people like that out. Of course, he had to, poor old
 chap, with no money of his own. .
 Hope they'd do one well in drinks. Never knew with these fellows who'd made
 their money and weren't born to it. Pity that story about Gabrielle Turl
 having bought Indian Island wasn't true. He'd like to have been in with
 that film star crowd. Oh, well, he supposed there'd be a few girls there.
 . . .
 Coming out of the Hotel, he stretched himself, yawned, looked up at the
 blue sky and climbed into the Dalmain.
 Several young women looked at him admiringly-his six feet of well-
 proportioned body, his crisp hair, tanned face, and intensely blue eyes.

 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE

 He let in the clutch with a roar and leapt up the narrow street. Old men
 and errand boys jumped for safety. The latter looked after the car
 admiringly. Anthony Marston proceeded on his triumphal progress.

 Mr. Blore was in the slow train from Plymouth. There was only one other
 person in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye.
 At the present moment he had dropped off to sleep.
 Mr. Blore was writing carefully in a little notebook.
 "That's the lot," he muttered to himself. "Emily Brent, Vera Claythorne,
 Dr. Armstrong, Anthony Marston, old Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard,
 General Macarthur, C.M.G., D.S.O. Manservant and wife: Mr. and Mrs.
 Rogers." He closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. He glanced
 over at the comer and the slumbering man.
 "Had one over the eight," diagnosed Mr. Blore accurately.
 He went over things carefully and conscientiously in his mind.
 "Job ought to be easy enough," he ruminated. "Don't see how I can slip up
 on it. Hope I look all right."
 He stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass. The face
 reflected there was of a slightly military cast with a moustache. There was
 very little expression in it. The eyes were grey and set rather close
 together. "Might be a Major," said Mr. Blore. "No, I forgot. There's that
 old military gent. He'd spot me at once.
 "South Africa," said Mr. Blore, "that's my line! None of these people have
 anything to do with South Africa, and I've just been reading that travel
 folder so I can talk about it all right."
 Fortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials. As a man of means
 from South Africa, Mr. Blore felt that he could enter into any society
 unchallenged. Indian Island. He remembered Indian Island as a boy.
 Smelly sort of rock covered with gulls-stood about a mile from the coast.
 It had got its name from its resemblance to a man's head-an American Indian
 profile. Funny idea to go and build a house on it! Awful in bad weather!
 But millionaires were full of wbims!

 The old man in the comer woke up and said:
 "You can't never tell at sea-never!"
 Mr. Blore said soothingly, "That's right. You can't."
 The old man hiccuped twice and said plaintively:
 "There's a squall coming."
 Mr. Blore said:
 "No, no, mate, it's a lovely day."

 CHAPTER 1

 IN THE CORNER of a first-class smoking carriage, Mr. Justice Wargrave,
 lately retired from the bench, puffed at a cigar and ran an interested eye
 through the political news in the Times.
 He laid the paper down and glanced out of the window. They were running now
 through Somerset. He glanced at his watch-another two hours to go. He went
 over in his mind all that had appeared in the papers about Indian Island.
 There had been its original purchase by an American millionaire who was crazy
 about yachting-and an account of the luxurious modern house he had built on
 this little island off the Devon coast. The unfortunate fact that the new
 third wife of the American millionaire was a bad sailor had led to the
 subsequent putting up of the house and island for sale. Various glowing
 advertisements of it had appeared in the papers. Then came the first bald
 statement that it had been bought-by a Mr. Owen. After that the rurnours
 of the gossip writers had started. Indian Island had really been bought by
 Miss Gabrielle Turl, the Hollywood film star! She wanted to spend some
 months there free from all publicity! Busy Bee had hinted delicately that
 it was to be an abode for Royalty??! Mr. Merryweather had had it whispered
 to him that it had been bought for a honeymoon-Young Lord L-- had
 surrendered to Cupid at last! Jonas knew for a fact that it had been
 purchased by the Admiralty with a view to carrying out some very hush hush
 experiments!
 Definitely, Indian Island was news!
 From his pocket Mr. Justice Wargrave drew out a letter. The handwriting was
 practically illegible but words here and there stood out with unexpected
 clarity. Dearest Lawrence . . . such years since I heard anything of you
 . . . must come to Indian Island . . . the most enchanting place . . . so
 much to talk over . . . old days . . . communion with Nature . . . bask
 in sunshine . . . 12.40 from Paddington . . . meet you at Oakbridge . . .
 and his correspondent signed herself with
 a flourish his ever Constance Culmington.
 Mr. Justice Wargrave cast back in his mind to remember when exactly he had
 last seen Lady Constance Culmington. It must be seven -no, eight years ago.
 She had then been going to Italy to bask in the sun and be at one with
 Nature and the contaditd. Later, he had heard, she had proceeded to Syria
 where she proposed to bask in yet stronger sun and live at one with Nature
 and the bedouin. Constance Culmington, he reflected to himself, was exactly
 the sort of woman who would buy an island and surround herself with
 mystery! Nodding his head in gentle approval of his logic, Mr. Justice
 Wargrave allowed his head to nod. He slept. . . .

 Vera Claythorne, in a third-class carriage with five other travellers in
 it, leaned her head back and shut her eyes. How hot it was travelling by
 train to-day! It would be nice to get to the sea! Really a great piece of
 luck getting this job. When you wanted a holiday post it nearly always
 meant looking after a swarm of children-secretarial holiday posts were much
 more difficult to get. Even the agency hadn't held out much hope.
 And then the letter had come.

 "I have received your name from the Skilled Women's Agency together with
 their recommendation. I understand they know you personally. I shall be
 glad to pay you the salary you ask and shall expect you to take up your
 duties on August 8th. The train is the 12.40 from Paddington and you will
 be met at Oakbridge station. I enclose five pound notes for expenses.

 Yours truly,
 Una Nancy Owen."

 And at the top was the stamped address Indian Island, Sticklehaven, Devon.
 . . .
 Indian Island! Why, there had been nothing else in the papers lately! All
 sorts of hints and interesting rumours. Though probably

 that was mostly untrue. But the house had certainly been built by a
 millionaire and was said to be absolutely the last word in luxury.
 Vera Claythorne, tired by a recent strenuous term at school, thought to
 herself-"Being a games mistress in a third-class school isn't much of a
 catch. school."
 And then, with a cold feeling round her heart, she thought: "But I'm lucky
 to have even this. After all, people don't like a Coroner's Inquest, even
 if the Coroner did acquit me of all blame!"
 He had even complimented her on her presence of mind and courage, she
 remembered. For an inquest it couldn't have gone better. And Mrs. Hamilton
 had been kindness itself to her- Only Hugo(but she wouldn't think of Hugo!)
 Suddenly, in spite of the heat in the carriage she shivered and wished she
 wasn't going to the sea. A picture rose clearly before her mind. Cyril's
 head, bobbing up and down, swimming to the rock. . . . Up and down-up and
 down. . . . And herself, swimming in easy practised strokes after him-
 cleaving her way through the water but knowing, only too surely, that she
 wouldn't be in time. . . . The sea-its deep warm blue-mornings spent lying
 out on the sands-Hugo-Hugo who had said he loved her.
 She must not think of Hugo. . . .
 She opened her eyes and frowned across at the man opposite her. A tall man
 with a brown face, light eyes set rather close together and an arrogant
 almost cruel mouth.
 She thought to herself:
 "I bet he's been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some
 interesting things. . . ."

 . If only I could get a job at some decent

 Philip Lombard, summing up the girl opposite in a mere flash of
 his quick moving eyes thought to himself:
 "Quite attractive-a bit schoolmistressy perhaps.
 A cool customer, he should imagine-and one who could hold her
 own-in love or war. He'd rather like to take her on. . . .
 He frowned. No, cut out all that kind of stuff. This was business. He'd got
 to keep his mind on the job.
 194 MASTERPIECES OF MURDER

 What exactly was up, he wondered? That little Jew had been damned
 mysterious. "Take it or leave it, Captain Lombard."
 He had said thoughtfully:
 "A hundred guineas, eh?"
 He had said it in a casual way as though a hundred guineas was nothing to
 him. A hundred guineas when he was literally down to his last square meal!
 He had fancied, though, that the little Jew had not been deceived-that was
 the damnable part about Jews, you couldn't deceive them about money-they
 knewl
 He had said in the same casual tone:
 "And you can't give me any further information?"
 Mr. Isaac Morris had shaken his little bald head very positively.
 "No, Captain Lombard, the matter rests there. It is understood by my client
 that your reputation is that of a good man in a tight place. I am empowered
 to hand you one hundred guineas in return for which you will travel to
 Sticklehaven, Devon. The nearest station is Oakbridge, you will be met
 there and motored to Sticklehaven where a motor launch will convey you to
 Indian Island. There you will hold yourself at the disposal of my client."
 Lombard had said abruptly:
 "For how long?"
 "Not longer than a week at most."
 Fingering his small moustache, Captain Lombard said:
 "You understand I can't undertake anything-illegal?"
 He had darted a very sharp glance at the other as he had spoken. There had
 been a very faint smile on the thick Semitic lips of Mr. Morris as he
 answered gravely:
 "If anything illegal is proposed, you will, of course, be at perfect
 liberty to withdraw."
 Damn the smooth little brute, he had smiled! It was as though he knew very
 well that in Lombard's past actions legality had not always been a sine qua
 non. . Lombard's own lips parted in a grin.
 By Jove, he'd sailed pretty near the wind once or twice! But he'd always
 got away with it! There wasn't much he drew the line at really. . . .
 No, there wasn't much he'd draw the fine at. He fancied that he was going
 to enjoy himself at Indian Island. . . .

 In a non-smoking carriage Miss Emily Brent sat very upright as was her
 custom. She was sixty-five and she did not approve of lounging. Her father,
 a Colonel of the old school, had been particular about deportment.
 The present generation was shamelessly lax-in their carriage, and in every
 other way.
 Enveloped in an aura of righteousness and unyielding principles, Miss Brent
 sat in her crowded third-class carriage and triumphed over its discomfort
 and its heat. Every one made such a fuss over things nowadays! They wanted
 injections before they had teeth pulled -they took drugs if they couldn't
 sleep-they wanted easy chairs and cushions and the girls allowed their
 figures to slop about anyhow and lay about half naked on the beaches in
 summer.
 Miss Brent's lips set closely. She would like to make an example of certain
 people.
 She remembered last year's summer holiday. This year, however, it would be
 quite different. Indian Island. . . .
 Mentally she reread the letter which she had already read so many times.
 
 Dear Miss Brent,
 I do hope you remember me? We were together at Bellhaven Guest House in
 August some years ago, and we seemed to have so much in common.
 I am starting a guest house of my own on an island og the coast of Devon.
 I think there is really an opening for a place where there is good plain
 cooking and a nice old-fashioned type of person. None of this nudity and
 gramophones half the night. I shall be very glad if you could see your way
 to spending your summer holiday on Indian Island-quite free-as my guest.
 Would early in August suit you? Perhaps the 81h.

 Yours sincerely,

 U. N. -
 What was the name? The signature was rather difficult to read. Emily Brent
 thought impatiently: "So many people write their signatures quite
 illegibly."

 She let her mind run back over the people at Bellhaven. She had been there
 two summers running. There had been that nice middleaged woman-Mrs.-Mrs.-
 now what was her name?-her father had been a Canon. And there had been a
 Miss Olton-Ormen- No, surely it was Oliver! Yes-Oliver.
 Indian Island! There had been things in the paper about Indian Island-
 something about a film star-or was it an American millionaire?
 Of course often those places went very cheap-islands didn't suit everybody.
 They thought the idea was romantic but when they came to live there they
 realized the disadvantages and were only too glad to sell.
 Emily Brent thought to herself: "I shall be getting a free holiday at any
 rate." With her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being
 paid, that was indeed something to take into consideration. If only she
 could remember a little more about Mrs.-or was it MissOliver?

 General Macarthur looked out of the carriage window. The train was just
 coming into Exeter where he had to change. Damnable, these slow branch line
 trains! This place, Indian Island, was really no distance at all as the
 crow flies. He hadn't got it clear who this fellow Owen was. A friend of
 Spoof Leggard's, apparently-and of Johnny Dyer's.
 -One or two of your old cronies are coming-would like to have a talk over
 old times.
 Well, he'd enjoy a chat about old times. He'd had a fancy lately that
 fellows were rather fighting shy of him. All owing to that damned rumour!
 By God, it was pretty hard-nearly thirty years ago now! Armitage had
 talked, he supposed. Damned young pup! What did he know about it? Oh, well,
 no good brooding about these things! One fancied things sometimes-fancied
 a fellow was looking at you queerly. This Indian Island now, he'd be
 interested to see it. A lot of gossip flying about. Looked as though there
 might be something in the

 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE

 rumour that the Admiralty or the War Office or the Air Force had got hold
 of it. . . .
 Young Elmer Robson, the American millionaire, had actually built the place.
 Spent thousands on it, so it was said. Every mortal luxury. . . .
 Exeter! And an hour to wait! And he didn't want to wait. He wanted to get
 on.

 Dr. Armstrong was driving his Morris across Salisbury Plain. He was very
 tired. . . . Success had its penalties. There had been a time when he had
 sat in his consulting room in Harley Street, correctly apparelled,
 surrounded with the most up-to-date appliances and the most luxurious
 furnishings and waited-waited through the empty days for his venture to
 succeed or fail. . . *
 Well, it had succeeded! He'd been lucky! Lucky and skilful of course. He
 was a good man at his job-but that wasn't enough for success. You had to
 have luck as well. And he'd had it! An accurate diagnosis, a couple of
 grateful women patients-women with money and position-and word had got
 about. "You ought to try Armstrong -quite a young man-but so clever- Pam
 had been to all sorts of people for years and he put his finger on the
 trouble at once!" The ball had started rolling.
 And now Dr. Armstrong had definitely arrived. His days were full. He had
 little leisure. And so, on this August morning, he was glad that he was
 leaving London and going to be for some days on an island off the Devon
 coast. Not that it was exactly a holiday. The letter he had received had
 been rather vague in its terms, but there was nothing vague about the

 Tony Marston, roaring down into Mere, thought to himself:

 Who were these Owens, he wondered? Rich and stinking, probably. Badger was
 rather good at nosing people like that out. Of course, he had to, poor old

 Mr. Blore was in the slow train from Plymouth. There was only one other
 person in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye.
 At the present moment he had dropped off to sleep.
 Mr. Blore was writing carefully in a little notebook.
 "That's the lot," he muttered to himself. "Emily Brent, Vera Claythorne,
 Dr. Armstrong, Anthony Marston, old Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard,
 General Macarthur, C.M.G., D.S.O. Manservant and wife: Mr. and Mrs.
 Rogers." He closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. He glanced
 over at the comer and the slumbering man.
 "Had one over the eight," diagnosed Mr. Blore accurately.
 He went over things carefully and conscientiously in his mind.
 "Job ought to be easy enough," he ruminated. "Don't see how I can slip up

 Mr. Justice Wargrave cast back in his mind to remember when exactly he had
 last seen Lady Constance Culmington. It must be seven -no, eight years ago.
 She had then been going to Italy to bask in the sun and be at one with
 Nature and the contaditd. Later, he had heard, she had proceeded to Syria
 where she proposed to bask in yet stronger sun and live at one with Nature
 and the bedouin. Constance Culmington, he reflected to himself, was exactly
 the sort of woman who would buy an island and surround herself with
 mystery! Nodding his head in gentle approval of his logic, Mr. Justice

 well that in Lombard's past actions legality had not always been a sine qua
 non. . Lombard's own lips parted in a grin.
 By Jove, he'd sailed pretty near the wind once or twice! But he'd always
 got away with it! There wasn't much he drew the line at really. . . .
 No, there wasn't much he'd draw the fine at. He fancied that he was going
 to enjoy himself at Indian Island. . . .

 In a non-smoking carriage Miss Emily Brent sat very upright as was her
 custom. She was sixty-five and she did not approve of lounging. Her father,
 a Colonel of the old school, had been particular about deportment.
 The present generation was shamelessly lax-in their carriage, and in every
 other way.
 Enveloped in an aura of righteousness and unyielding principles, Miss Brent
 sat in her crowded third-class carriage and triumphed over its discomfort
 and its heat. Every one made such a fuss over things nowadays! They wanted
 injections before they had teeth pulled -they took drugs if they couldn't
 sleep-they wanted easy chairs and cushions and the girls allowed their
 figures to slop about anyhow and lay about half naked on the beaches in
 summer.
 Miss Brent's lips set closely. She would like to make an example of certain
 people.
 She remembered last year's summer holiday. This year, however, it would be
 quite different. Indian Island. . . .
 Mentally she reread the letter which she had already read so many times.
 
 Dear Miss Brent,
 I do hope you remember me? We were together at Bellhaven Guest House in
 August some years ago, and we seemed to have so much in common.
 I am starting a guest house of my own on an island og the coast of Devon.
 I think there is really an opening for a place where there is good plain
 cooking and a nice old-fashioned type of person. None of this nudity and
 gramophones half the night. I shall be very glad if you could see your way
 to spending your summer holiday on Indian Island-quite free-as my guest.
 Would early in August suit you? Perhaps the 81h.

 Yours sincerely,

 U. N. -
 What was the name? The signature was rather difficult to read. Emily Brent
 thought impatiently: "So many people write their signatures quite
 illegibly."

 She let her mind run back over the people at Bellhaven. She had been there
 two summers running. There had been that nice middleaged woman-Mrs.-Mrs.-
 now what was her name?-her father had been a Canon. And there had been a
 Miss Olton-Ormen- No, surely it was Oliver! Yes-Oliver.
 Indian Island! There had been things in the paper about Indian Island-
 something about a film star-or was it an American millionaire?
 Of course often those places went very cheap-islands didn't suit everybody.
 They thought the idea was romantic but when they came to live there they
 realized the disadvantages and were only too glad to sell.
 Emily Brent thought to herself: "I shall be getting a free holiday at any
 rate." With her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being
 paid, that was indeed something to take into consideration. If only she
 could remember a little more about Mrs.-or was it MissOliver?

 General Macarthur looked out of the carriage window. The train was just
 coming into Exeter where he had to change. Damnable, these slow branch line
 trains! This place, Indian Island, was really no distance at all as the
 crow flies. He hadn't got it clear who this fellow Owen was. A friend of
 Spoof Leggard's, apparently-and of Johnny Dyer's.
 -One or two of your old cronies are coming-would like to have a talk over
 old times.
 Well, he'd enjoy a chat about old times. He'd had a fancy lately that
 fellows were rather fighting shy of him. All owing to that damned rumour!
 By God, it was pretty hard-nearly thirty years ago now! Armitage had
 talked, he supposed. Damned young pup! What did he know about it? Oh, well,
 no good brooding about these things! One fancied things sometimes-fancied
 a fellow was looking at you queerly. This Indian Island now, he'd be
 interested to see it. A lot of gossip flying about. Looked as though there
 might be something in the

 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE

 rumour that the Admiralty or the War Office or the Air Force had got hold
 of it. . . .
 Young Elmer Robson, the American millionaire, had actually built the place.
 Spent thousands on it, so it was said. Every mortal luxury. . . .
 Exeter! And an hour to wait! And he didn't want to wait. He wanted to get
 on.

 Dr. Armstrong was driving his Morris across Salisbury Plain. He was very
 tired. . . . Success had its penalties. There had been a time when he had
 sat in his consulting room in Harley Street, correctly apparelled,
 surrounded with the most up-to-date appliances and the most luxurious
 furnishings and waited-waited through the empty days for his venture to
 succeed or fail. . . *
 Well, it had succeeded! He'd been lucky! Lucky and skilful of course. He
 was a good man at his job-but that wasn't enough for success. You had to
 have luck as well. And he'd had it! An accurate diagnosis, a couple of
 grateful women patients-women with money and position-and word had got
 about. "You ought to try Armstrong -quite a young man-but so clever- Pam
 had been to all sorts of people for years and he put his finger on the
 trouble at once!" The ball had started rolling.
 And now Dr. Armstrong had definitely arrived. His days were full. He had
 little leisure. And so, on this August morning, he was glad that he was
 leaving London and going to be for some days on an island off the Devon
 coast. Not that it was exactly a holiday. The letter he had received had
 been rather vague in its terms, but there was nothing vague about the
 accompanying cheque. A whacking fee. These Owens must be rolling in money.
 Some little difficulty, it seemed, a husband who was worried about his
 wife's health and wanted a report on it without her being alarmed. She
 wouldn't hear of seeing a doctor. Her nerves-
 Nerves! The doctor's eyebrows went up. These women and their nerves! Well,
 it was good for business, after all. Half the women who consulted him had
 nothing the matter with them but boredom, but they wouldn't thank you for
 telling them so! And one could usually find something.

 "A slightly uncommon condition of the-some long word-nothing at all
 serious-but it just needs putting right. A simple treatment."
 Well, medicine was mostly faith-healing when it came to it. And he had a
 good manner-he could inspire hope and belief.
 Lucky that he'd managed to pull himself together in time after that
 business ten-no, fifteen years ago. It had been a near thing, that! He'd
 been going to pieces. The shock had pulled him together. He'd cut out drink
 altogether. By Jove, it had been a near thing though. . . .
 With a devastating ear-splitting blast on the hom an enormous Super Sports
 Dalmain car rushed past him at eighty miles an hour. Dr. Armstrong nearly
 went into the hedge. One of these young fools who tore round the country.
 He hated them. That had been a near shave, too. Damned young fool!

 Tony Marston, roaring down into Mere, thought to himself:
 "The amount of cars crawling about the roads is frightful. Always something
 blocking your way. And they will drive in the middle of the road! Pretty
 hopeless driving in England, anyway. . . . Not like France where you really
 could let out. . . ."
 Should he stop here for a drink, or push on? Heaps of time! Only another
 hundred miles and a bit to go. He'd have a gin and gingerbeer. Fizzing hot
 day! This island place ought to be rather good fun-if the weather lasted.
 Who were these Owens, he wondered? Rich and stinking, probably. Badger was
 rather good at nosing people like that out. Of course, he had to, poor old
 chap, with no money of his own. .
 Hope they'd do one well in drinks. Never knew with these fellows who'd made
 their money and weren't born to it. Pity that story about Gabrielle Turl
 having bought Indian Island wasn't true. He'd like to have been in with
 that film star crowd. Oh, well, he supposed there'd be a few girls there.
 . . .
 Coming out of the Hotel, he stretched himself, yawned, looked up at the
 blue sky and climbed into the Dalmain.
 Several young women looked at him admiringly-his six feet of well-
 proportioned body, his crisp hair, tanned face, and intensely blue eyes.

 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE

 He let in the clutch with a roar and leapt up the narrow street. Old men
 and errand boys jumped for safety. The latter looked after the car
 admiringly. Anthony Marston proceeded on his triumphal progress.

 Mr. Blore was in the slow train from Plymouth. There was only one other
 person in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye.
 At the present moment he had dropped off to sleep.
 Mr. Blore was writing carefully in a little notebook.
 "That's the lot," he muttered to himself. "Emily Brent, Vera Claythorne,
 Dr. Armstrong, Anthony Marston, old Justice Wargrave, Philip Lombard,
 General Macarthur, C.M.G., D.S.O. Manservant and wife: Mr. and Mrs.
 Rogers." He closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. He glanced
 over at the comer and the slumbering man.
 "Had one over the eight," diagnosed Mr. Blore accurately.
 He went over things carefully and conscientiously in his mind.
 "Job ought to be easy enough," he ruminated. "Don't see how I can slip up
 on it. Hope I look all right."
 He stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass. The face
 reflected there was of a slightly military cast with a moustache. There was
 very little expression in it. The eyes were grey and set rather close
 together. "Might be a Major," said Mr. Blore. "No, I forgot. There's that
 old military gent. He'd spot me at once.
 "South Africa," said Mr. Blore, "that's my line! None of these people have
 anything to do with South Africa, and I've just been reading that travel
 folder so I can talk about it all right."
 Fortunately there were all sorts and types of colonials. As a man of means
 from South Africa, Mr. Blore felt that he could enter into any society
 unchallenged. Indian Island. He remembered Indian Island as a boy.
 Smelly sort of rock covered with gulls-stood about a mile from the coast.
 It had got its name from its resemblance to a man's head-an American Indian
 profile. Funny idea to go and build a house on it! Awful in bad weather!
 But millionaires were full of wbims!

 The old man in the comer woke up and said:
 "You can't never tell at sea-never!"
 Mr. Blore said soothingly, "That's right. You can't."
 The old man hiccuped twice and said plaintively:
 "There's a squall coming."
 Mr. Blore said:
 "No, no, mate, it's a lovely day."
 The old man said angrily:
